## Description

Lazy Fade is a simple plugin to enhance the presentation of your site. As the user scrolls, content will slightly fade and animate into view, adding a more natural look and feel to the experience. Furthermore, images "below the fold" will only load when they come into view, saving download time and optimizing your site.

## Features

- Content will smoothly glide and fade into view.
- Images will load only when they appear when scrolling.
- Free!

## Installation

1. Upload the `lazy-fade` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. That's it!
